## Note on using "routes"/"path"

-   "{email}" indicates that you should fill it with the actual email
-   Ex. for route /register/{email}/{password}/{fullname}, fill it like /register/john@gmail.com/myPassword/John Doe
-   Expect routes to be in the format /(route name)/(var_1, var_2,...var_n)

## Notes about organization

-   Image based APIs were moved from Images.md (removed) to their related .md files
    -   Ex. account profile picture is in AccountRelated.md
