!!THESE QUERIES CAN BE USED FOR BOTH CASSANDRA AND POSTGRE FOR TESTING PURPOSES!!

New table for testing, bad idea to update primary keys
Create Table Basic(key int PRIMARY KEY, value int NOT NULL);

Using variables instead of hard coded values now
May need to ask ChatGPT to fix the syntax of these


Insert Into Basic (key,value) VALUES (x,y)

Select * From Basic Where key = x

Update Basic Set value = y Where key = x

Delete From Basic Where value = w

Select key From Basic Where value < x And value > y
