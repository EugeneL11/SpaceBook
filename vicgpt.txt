App.jsx is the root/parent component

It has a state called screen or mainscreen(I forget what I called it) and something to set the state

So every function defined in there changes the screen

And the login component needs a way to tell App.jsx to change the screen to the register screen for instance

So the login component needs the function that changes the screen to register(js is dynamically typed so you 
can pass in literally anything you want) as a prop

So you see how every function in there sets the screen and passes in multiple props to that screen because 
the screen also needs to tell App.jsx when it should change screens
